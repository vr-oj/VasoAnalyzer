# Welcome Tour — VasoAnalyzer v2.2.5

Use this short tour for the in‑app welcome dialog or a first‑run overlay.

---

**Step 1 — Create or Open a Project**  
Start a new project or open a recent one. Projects are single `*.vaso` files that remember your view.

**Step 2 — Add Data**  
Click **+ Data** to add a Trace CSV. Columns should include **Time (s)** and **Inner Diameter (µm)** (optional **Outer Diameter (µm)**).

**Step 3 — (Optional) Load Events**  
If you have an events CSV/TXT with **Time** and **Label**, load it now. We’ll auto‑detect common header names.

**Step 4 — (Optional) Add a Snapshot**  
Load a TIFF stack for a representative image. Large stacks are previewed with sub‑sampling to stay snappy.

**Step 5 — Explore & Annotate**  
Zoom and pan around your trace. Insert or edit event pins directly on the timeline. Use **Plot Settings** to adjust fonts, axes, and grid.

**Step 6 — Export**  
Export your **event table** (CSV), **figure** (TIFF/SVG), or **session state** (JSON). The event CSV saves next to your trace file.

**Step 7 — Save**  
Hit **Save** to capture your progress to the `.vaso` project. You can reopen tomorrow to the exact same view.

> Checkbox: “Don’t show this again” (you can re‑enable the tour from Help later).
